# multi-os-tester
This project ensures your Python code runs smoothly across multiple operating systems (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows) and Python versions (3.8â€“3.13) using GitHub Actions. It uses a matrix strategy to test all OS-version combinations in parallel, helping catch environment-specific bugs early.

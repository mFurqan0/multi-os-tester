 Multi-OS Python Testing with GitHub Actions

This project ensures your Python code runs smoothly across **multiple operating systems** (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows) and **Python versions** (3.8â€“3.13) using GitHub Actions. It uses a **matrix strategy** to test all OS-version combinations in parallel, helping catch environment-specific bugs early.  

The setup includes:
- Python code with tests
- A workflow file to automate testing
- GitHub Actions for CI integration

Perfect for projects that need wide compatibility and reliable automated testingðŸš€
